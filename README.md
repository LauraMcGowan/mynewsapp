#Ideas for News Website

#Wire frames 

•	Next button on each page to allows user to go to the next article
•	A share button icon if the user wishes to share the articles on their social platforms
•	The articles can be ranked using stars/ half stars on the last page then they can be submitted via the submit button
•	I would use React list components for the last page        

#For HTTPS Requests/GET Requests

I would use axios, a promise-based HTTP client library for the GET/POST and HTTP requests.


#Testing

•	Unit testing with test cases describe blocks using jest/node
•	Functionality testing 
•	Usability testing
•	Interface testing 
•	Compatibility testing 
•	Performance testing 
•	Security testing 
•	End to end tests

#Error handling

I would use react components. Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. The Error boundaries catch errors during rendering and also in constructors of the whole tree below them. This would be for class components only.
